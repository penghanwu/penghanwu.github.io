	  <dt>My name is Penghan Wu, the student number is  S3714036, my E-mail is s3714036@rmit.edu.au, I am from China and I finished my junior high school in China. I came to Melbourne to study in high school in 2013. At present, my language ability is also good, especially in writing and listening. I am particularly interested in software development because I am curious as to why others can develop software that interests me, so I also want to have my own software. In my spare time, I like to watch videos about animals and technology, which will be very interesting to me.</dt>
			<dd>Background</dd>
	  <dt>IT is information technology, sensing technology, communication technology, computer technology and control technology. In my opinion, it is the technology that acquires information, controls and uses their functions. The four technologies of IT play different roles, but they are closely related. Data and materials useful for human activities can be referred to as information. Therefore, the information technology industry refers to the information on the production, circulation and sales of information and the corresponding information science theory.</dt>
		    <dd>Interest</dd>
		<dt>I was particularly interested in IT when I first came into contact with a computer .I will study why search engines will tell me what answers I want and how these sites are made. These questions are deeply appealing to me. When I went to college, I chose this major without hesitation and I chose rmit, where I can learn the most professional knowledge and technology.First of all, IT will bring me constant self-challenge. When I see my research results, I will have a great sense of accomplishment. In today's society, technology is a promising industry. Not only does IT continue to have new technologies, but professionals are in a state of scarcity at any time, so I believe that mastering professional technology will make it easier to succeed.</dt>
			<dd>Ideal job</dd><br>
		<dt>My ideal job is a software engineer, which may be a fundamental job in the entire IT industry. According to the development progress and task assignment, complete the design, development and programming tasks of the corresponding module software. In addition, functional testing is performed to detect defects in the software and to maintain the usability and stability of the software. Although software development is a difficult process, it requires procedures such as analysis, software code writing, software testing, and software maintenance. But such a role plays a very important role, and I also hope that I can develop good software.</dt>
